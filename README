This is day one of the latest iteration of the FACore library (Finite Automaton Core). There have been 3 previous versions written in a variety of languages, all of which have been open source but none of which have been in a public forum such as github.

It will take some time to re-implement the functionality, so for now consider this to be a work in progress.

The only requirements are boost and c++11. To build and run the unit test, execute the following:

> g++ -std=c++11 test/TestDeterministicAutomaton.cpp -I src
> ./a.out

Over and out
